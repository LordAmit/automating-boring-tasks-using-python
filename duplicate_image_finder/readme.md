# Duplicate Image Finder

Uses source code inspired/copied from https://github.com/philipbl/duplicate-images.git.

Significant changes are:

1. moves from `mongodb` to `sqlite`
2. Is probably better in terms of finding similar images (or perhaps I misunderstood the previous code)

Concepts/Technologies I learned/tried to learn while doing this:

1. `poetry`
2. `pytest`
3. `pysqlite3`
4. `concurrency`
5. `imagehash`
